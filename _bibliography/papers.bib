  abstract={There is an ever-growing mismatch between the proliferation of data-intensive, power-hungry deep learning solutions in the machine learning (ML) community and the need for agile, portable solutions in resource-constrained devices, particularly for intelligence at the edge. In this paper, we present a fundamentally novel approach that leverages data-driven intelligence with biologically-inspired efficiency. The proposed Sparse Embodiment Neural-Statistical Architecture (SENSA) decomposes the learning task into two distinct phases: a training phase and a hardware embedment phase where prototypes are extracted from the trained network and used to construct fast, sparse embodiment for hardware deployment at the edge. Specifically, we propose the Sparse Pulse Automata via Reproducing Kernel (SPARK) method, which first constructs a learning machine in the form of a dynamical system using energy-efficient spike or pulse trains, commonly used in neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering, then extracts a rule-based solution in the form of automata or lookup tables for rapid deployment in edge computing platforms. We propose to use the theoretically-grounded unifying framework of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to provide interpretable, nonlinear, and nonparametric solutions, compared to the typical neural network approach. In kernel methods, the explicit representation of the data is of secondary nature, allowing the same algorithm to be used for different data types without altering the learning rules. To showcase SPARKâ€™s capabilities, we carried out the first proof-of-concept demonstration on the task of isolated-word automatic speech recognition (ASR) or keyword spotting, benchmarked on the TI-46 digit corpus. Together, these energy-efficient and resource-conscious techniques will bring advanced machine learning solutions closer to the edge.},

  abstract={We present a general nonlinear Bayesian filter for high-dimensional state estimation using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). By applying the kernel method and the representer theorem to perform linear quadratic estimation in a functional space, we derive a Bayesian recursive state estimator for a general nonlinear dynamical system in the original input space. Unlike existing nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter where the system dynamics are assumed known, the state-space representation for the Functional Bayesian Filter (FBF) is completely learned online from measurement data in the form of an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter or recurrent network in the RKHS, with universal approximation property. Using a positive definite kernel function satisfying Mercer's conditions to compute and evolve information quantities, the FBF exploits both the statistical and time-domain information about the signal, extracts higher-order moments, and preserves the properties of covariances without the ill effects due to conventional arithmetic operations. We apply this novel kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) to recurrent network training, chaotic time-series estimation and cooperative filtering using Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises, and inverse kinematics modeling. Simulation results show FBF outperforms existing Kalman-based algorithms.},

  abstract={There is an ever-growing mismatch between the proliferation of data-intensive, power-hungry deep learning solutions in the machine learning (ML) community and the need for agile, portable solutions in resource-constrained devices, particularly for intelligence at the edge. In this paper, we present a fundamentally novel approach that leverages data-driven intelligence with biologically-inspired efficiency. The proposed Sparse Embodiment Neural-Statistical Architecture (SENSA) decomposes the learning task into two distinct phases: a training phase and a hardware embedment phase where prototypes are extracted from the trained network and used to construct fast, sparse embodiment for hardware deployment at the edge. Specifically, we propose the Sparse Pulse Automata via Reproducing Kernel (SPARK) method, which first constructs a learning machine in the form of a dynamical system using energy-efficient spike or pulse trains, commonly used in neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering, then extracts a rule-based solution in the form of automata or lookup tables for rapid deployment in edge computing platforms. We propose to use the theoretically-grounded unifying framework of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to provide interpretable, nonlinear, and nonparametric solutions, compared to the typical neural network approach. In kernel methods, the explicit representation of the data is of secondary nature, allowing the same algorithm to be used for different data types without altering the learning rules. To showcase SPARK’s capabilities, we carried out the first proof-of-concept demonstration on the task of isolated-word automatic speech recognition (ASR) or keyword spotting, benchmarked on the TI-46 digit corpus. Together, these energy-efficient and resource-conscious techniques will bring advanced machine learning solutions closer to the edge.},

  abstract={We present a general nonlinear Bayesian filter for high-dimensional state estimation using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). By applying the kernel method and the representer theorem to perform linear quadratic estimation in a functional space, we derive a Bayesian recursive state estimator for a general nonlinear dynamical system in the original input space. Unlike existing nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter where the system dynamics are assumed known, the state-space representation for the Functional Bayesian Filter (FBF) is completely learned online from measurement data in the form of an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter or recurrent network in the RKHS, with universal approximation property. Using a positive definite kernel function satisfying Mercer's conditions to compute and evolve information quantities, the FBF exploits both the statistical and time-domain information about the signal, extracts higher-order moments, and preserves the properties of covariances without the ill effects due to conventional arithmetic operations. We apply this novel kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) to recurrent network training, chaotic time-series estimation and cooperative filtering using Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises, and inverse kinematics modeling. Simulation results show FBF outperforms existing Kalman-based algorithms.},

  abstract={Evidence shows diabetes mellitus (DM) is major independent risk factor for several cardiovascular disorders including heart failure (HF). Large, randomized clinical trials for screening and revascularization of stable macrovascular disease in diabetics, have failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiac events and HF episodes. Studies have demonstrated that early detection of left ventricular dysfunction and prevention of microvascular complications through glycemic control in diabetes patients is a critical mechanism for reducing the incidence and severity of left ventricular dysfunction and HF.  There is a need for a non-invasive, affordable, accurate, absolute and actionable method to facilitate optimized management of diabetes patients across the continuity of care.

  publisher = {arXiv},
  year = {2020},
  abstract={Kernel methods form a theoretically-grounded, powerful and versatile framework to solve nonlinear problems in signal processing and machine learning. The standard approach relies on the \emph{kernel trick} to perform pairwise evaluations of a kernel function, leading to scalability issues for large datasets due to its linear and superlinear growth with respect to the training data. Recently, we proposed \emph{no-trick} (NT) kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) that leverages explicit feature space mappings using data-independent basis with constant complexity. The inner product defined by the feature mapping corresponds to a positive-definite finite-rank kernel that induces a finite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Information theoretic learning (ITL) is a framework where information theory descriptors based on non-parametric estimator of Renyi entropy replace conventional second-order statistics for the design of adaptive systems. An RKHS for ITL defined on a space of probability density functions simplifies statistical inference for supervised or unsupervised learning. ITL criteria take into account the higher-order statistical behavior of the systems and signals as desired. However, this comes at a cost of increased computational complexity. In this paper, we extend the NT kernel concept to ITL for improved information extraction from the signal without compromising scalability. Specifically, we focus on a family of fast, scalable, and accurate estimators for ITL using explicit inner product space (EIPS) kernels. We demonstrate the superior performance of EIPS-ITL estimators and combined NT-KAF using EIPS-ITL cost functions through experiments.},

  publisher = {arXiv},

  abstract={Kernel methods form a powerful, versatile, and theoretically-grounded unifying framework to solve nonlinear problems in signal processing and machine learning. The standard approach relies on the kernel trick to perform pairwise evaluations of a kernel function, which leads to scalability issues for large datasets due to its linear and superlinear growth with respect to the training data. A popular approach to tackle this problem, known as random Fourier features (RFFs), samples from a distribution to obtain the data-independent basis of a higher finite-dimensional feature space, where its dot product approximates the kernel function. Recently, deterministic, rather than random construction has been shown to outperform RFFs, by approximating the kernel in the frequency domain using Gaussian quadrature. In this paper, we view the dot product of these explicit mappings not as an approximation, but as an equivalent positive-definite kernel that induces a new finite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This opens the door to no-trick (NT) online kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) that is scalable and robust. Random features are prone to large variances in performance, especially for smaller dimensions. Here, we focus on deterministic feature-map construction based on polynomial-exact solutions and show their superiority over random constructions. Without loss of generality, we apply this approach to classical adaptive filtering algorithms and validate the methodology to show that deterministic features are faster to generate and outperform state-of-the-art kernel methods based on random Fourier features.},

Surprise and novelty criteria have always been used individually in designing sparse kernel machines. While closely related, they are in fact two distinct concepts.

We test the information theoretic approach of designing sparse kernel adaptive filters using the surprise-novelty information processing for Gaussian online active learning (SNIP-GOAL) on the task of nonlinear chaotic time series prediction. The proposed method outperforms existing algorithms using the measures individually. Results show that combining surprise and novelty can be advantageous in terms of efficiency and performance.

  abstract={We propose a novel cascaded classification technique called the Nearest Instance Centroid Estimation (NICE) LDA algorithm. Our algorithm (inspired from NICE KLMS) performs a cascade combination of two weak classifiers - threshold based class-wise clustering and linear discriminant classification to achieve state-of-the-art results on various high dimensional UCI datasets. We show how our method is more robust towards skewed data and computationally more efficient than previous methods of combining clustering with classification techniques. We also develop an efficient aggregation method based on instance based learning that implements this cascade combination of classifiers in a much simpler manner computationally. We demonstrate that our method of data clustering and LDA implementation, while introducing only one free parameter, leads to results that are similar and often better than those achieved by the state-of-the-art kernel RBF SVMs.},

  ABSTRACT={This paper presents a novel real-time dynamic framework for quantifying time-series structure in spoken words using spikes. Audio signals are converted into multi-channel spike trains using a biologically-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spike generator. These spike trains are mapped into a function space of infinite dimension, i.e., a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using point-process kernels, where a state-space model learns the dynamics of the multidimensional spike input using gradient descent learning. This kernelized recurrent system is very parsimonious and achieves the necessary memory depth via feedback of its internal states when trained discriminatively, utilizing the full context of the phoneme sequence. A main advantage of modeling nonlinear dynamics using state-space trajectories in the RKHS is that it imposes no restriction on the relationship between the exogenous input and its internal state. We are free to choose the input representation with an appropriate kernel, and changing the kernel does not impact the system nor the learning algorithm. Moreover, we show that this novel framework can outperform both traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) speech processing as well as neuromorphic implementations based on spiking neural network (SNN), yielding accurate and ultra-low power word spotters. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its capabilities using the benchmark TI-46 digit corpus for isolated-word automatic speech recognition (ASR) or keyword spotting. Compared to HMM using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) front-end without time-derivatives, our MFCC-KAARMA offered improved performance. For spike-train front-end, spike-KAARMA also outperformed state-of-the-art SNN solutions. Furthermore, compared to MFCCs, spike trains provided enhanced noise robustness in certain low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.},

  abstract={We propose a novel nearest-neighbors approach to organize and curb the growth of radial basis function network in kernel adaptive filtering (KAF). The nearest-instance-centroid-estimation (NICE) kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithm provides an appropriate time-space tradeoff with good performance. Its centers in the input/feature space are organized by quasi-orthogonal regions for greatly simplified filter evaluation. Instead of using all centers to evaluate/update the function approximation at every new point, a linear search among the iteratively-updated centroids determines the partial function to be used, naturally forming locally-supported partial functionals. Under this framework, partial functionals that compose the adaptive filter are quickly stored/retrieved based on input, each corresponding to a specialized “spatial-band” subfilter. The filter evaluation becomes the update of one of the subfilters, creating a content addressable filter bank (CAFB). This CAFB is incrementally updated for new signal applications with mild constraints, always using the past-learned partial filter sums, opening the door for transfer learning and significant efficiency for new data scenarios, avoiding training from scratch as have been done since the invention of adaptive filtering. Using energy conservation relation, we show the sufficient condition for mean square convergence of the NICE-KLMS algorithm and establish the upper and lower bounds of steady-state excess-mean-square-error (EMSE). Simulations on chaotic time-series prediction demonstrate similar levels of accuracy as existing methods, but with much faster computation involving fewer input samples. Simulations on transfer learning using both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that NICE CAFB can leverage previously learned knowledge to related task or domain.},

Results show multiclass KAARMA STEM can automatically identify plant species based on growth patterns. Furthermore, finite state machines extracted from trained KAARMA STEM retains competitive performance and are robust to noise. Automatically constructing an L-system or formal grammar to replicate a spatiotemporal structure is an open problem. This is an important first step to not only identify plants but also to generate realistic plant models automatically from observations.},

An emerging technology uses noninvasive laser sensors to capture flight information of flying insects in situ. However current computational entomology methods treat these optical signals as static patterns, rather than time series. We propose to evaluate each insect passage as a nonstationary process involving a sequence of pseudo-acoustic frames and model the short-term flight dynamics using a kernel adaptive autoregressive-moving-average (KAARMA) network. Since flight behavior is both nonlinear and nonstationary in nature, dynamic modeling provides a general framework that fully exploits the transitional and contextual information. Using the kernel adaptive ARMA algorithm and spatial clustering, each flight passage is defined to be an ordered sequence of states in a discretized spatiotemporal space. The state transition trajectories are used to construct a finite state machine (FSM) recognizer. The computational efficiency of the automaton classifier eliminates the need to perform numeric computations and enables realtime performance with far-reaching implications in entomology, agriculture, and disease control and prevention. Results show multiclass KAARMA classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art AIR methods, using support vector machine (SVM), deep learning autoencoder, and batch learning, in identifying Zika vector mosquito Aedes aegypti among five species of flying insects, while using significantly more efficient data representation.
